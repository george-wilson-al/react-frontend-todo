## âœ¨ React/Tailwind Todo App

Based on the original [here](https://github.com/jvikraman/react-tailwind-todo-app) but modified to be on updated dependencies
and to interact with the [sample Koa Rest App](https://github.com/george-wilson-al/koa-rest). Between these two applications
is a modern MERN application designed for testing purposes.
